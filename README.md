# 👋 Hi! I'm Oad

I am an Astronomy Olympiad medalist turned Computer Science major at NUS. I began my journey with an interest in developing AI models, but over time, I found myself become more attracted to areas such as computer networking and parallel computing. Beyond academics, I enjoy building simple yet powerful software that makes everyday tasks a little more intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable (hopefully). 😊
