# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Oad

I am an Astronomy Olympiad medalist turned Computer Science major at NUS. I began by pursuing AI but later discovered a stronger interest in algorithms, networking, and parallel computing. Beyond academics, I enjoy creating simple yet powerful software that helps people learn more effectively, think more clearly, and make a positive impact across disciplines :)
