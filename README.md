# ğŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Oad

I am an Astronomy Olympiad Medalist turned Computer Science major at NUS. While I first pursued AI, I later found myself drawn to areas like networking, compilers, and parallel computing. Beyond academics, I love building simple yet powerful software that makes a positive impact across disciplines :) You can explore my work and read my blog at [phanuphats.com](https://www.phanuphats.com/) ğŸ¦¦ğŸ’».
