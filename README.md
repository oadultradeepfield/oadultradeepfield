# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Oad

I am an Astronomy Olympiad Medalist turned Computer Science major. Currently, I am focusing on two things I enjoy: building interactive tools that help others learn complex concepts quickly and applying technology to create positive impact in non-technical fields :) You can explore my work and read my blog at [phanuphats.com](https://www.phanuphats.com/) ðŸ¦¦ðŸ’».
