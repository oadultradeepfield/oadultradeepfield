# ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Oad

I am an Astronomy Olympiad medalist turned Computer Science major at NUS. I began with an interest in developing AI models but later discovered a stronger passion for the theoretical side of AI and algorithms. Beyond academics, I enjoy creating simple yet powerful software that helps people learn more effectively, think more clearly, and make a positive impact across disciplines :)
