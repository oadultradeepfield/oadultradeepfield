# 👋 Hi! I'm Oad

I am an astronomy olympiad medalist turned CS student at NUS. I got into programming through AI research in high school, but these days I'm more interested in systems engineering, networking, and parallel computing. I also love building software that makes everyday tasks more enjoyable. 😊
